----------

## Features

### AutoPwn
- Start writting simple demo modules that can be improved later

### qjsNetworkSockets
- Add native support for SSL
- Add hook to replace node server by qjs while keeping logic and modules running in node (shared memory?)
- Benchmark real prod express apps in quickjs

### SelfControl
- Port to Kotlin
- Workflow to compile
- Add E2E testing with different Android versions

### DarkMeseenger & DarkMessengerAndroid
- Rewrite (need to swap design logic, modularize more and chose better language choices). 
> I don't have the proficence yet to code such complex design in Kotlin/Java, better to think about C++ or Javascript (web assembly?) designs.

### Puppeteer
- Fix puppeteer ARM / Musl support if no one else does

### DotEnvCleaner
- Add testing (and try usage on real project NeuroBlade)

### CLIPI
- Keep using CLIPI in real pentesting to find missing features

### BAHAMUT
- Make repo private before pushing local hacking modules

### Vulnera
- Keep adding new vulns
- Make repo less ugly

### AGENT

- Backup 

### TCP
- Keep adding to the documentation

### SteelSpellScale

- Improve battery usage

### MothSignal
